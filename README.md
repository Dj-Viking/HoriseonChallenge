# Horiseon Landing-Page Code Refactor

## Deployment Link:


## Description
This challenge encourages the process known as "Refactor". 

This means you rewrite some of the code to make it more accessible to other code readers- but also keeping the website look and functions exactly the same. So if something goes wrong later, they know where to look and easily see what was affected.

For example: instead of using `<div>` tags to separate out sections- use `<section>` or `<nav>` semantic tags. Also utilizing best practices to describe with comments what `<div>` or `<section>` will represent. Then, applying the same commenting practice to the CSS elements as well as placing the elements in the order of the HTML elements. 

Even though CSS doesn't care what order, HTML does. So keeping the elements in order will help to read both files in sequential order in which the elements will fall in the index.html file.
