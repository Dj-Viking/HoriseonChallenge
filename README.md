# horiseonChallenge
UCF Coding Bootcamp Week 1 Challenge

This challenge encourages the process known as "Refactor"
Basically means you rewrite some of the code to make it more accessible to other code readers. So if something goes wrong later, they know where to look and easily see what was affected.

For example: instead of using <div> tags to separate out sections or even <section> its best to describe with this div or section will represent. Perhaps naming it a more accesible semantic tag.
